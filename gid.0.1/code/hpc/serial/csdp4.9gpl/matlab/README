This directory contains the MATLAB interface to CSDP.  There are three
MATLAB functions:
 
  csdp              Solved a problem in SeDuMi format.
  writesdpa         Takes a problem in SeDuMi format and outputs it
                    to a file in SDPA sparse format.
  readsol           Reads a CSDP solution into the workspace in SeDuMi form.

Note that these .m files must be in your MATLAB search path, and that
the csdp executable must be in your shell's search path for this
interface to work.
