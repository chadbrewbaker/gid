This file includes source for a C code for SDP that uses BLAS and
LAPACK subroutines.  The directories are as follows:

  doc                  documentation.

  lib                  C source for libsdp.a.

  solver               C source for a program that reads in problems in
                       SDPA sparse format and solves them.  The subdirectory
                       testprob contains a test problem.  

  theta                A code for computing the Lovasz Theta number of 
                       a graph.  The theta code solves this problem directly.
                       A program called graphtoprob can be used to produce
                       a problem file in SDPA sparse format.  Also includes a 
                       random graph generator and a program to compute the 
                       complement of a graph.  The subdirectory testprob 
                       contains a number of test problems.  

  matlab               MATLAB routines for interfacing to CSDP.
