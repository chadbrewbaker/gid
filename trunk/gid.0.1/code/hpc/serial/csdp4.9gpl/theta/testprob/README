This subdirectory contains a collection of test problems for theta.  
Please note that the larger problems are large enough that you will not
be able to solve them on machines with limited virtual storage.  For 
example, problem g300 required 160 megabytes of virtual storage on 
our Sun Ultra 1/170.  

You can test that the code is working properly by issuing the command:
 
  ../theta g50 >myg50.out 
 
If your output isn't very similar to the output in g50.out, then something 
is probably wrong with your installation of the code.

The test problems in this directory were generated with rand_graph,
using n=50 to n=300 nodes, and p=0.1.  The following table summarizes
the results from running theta on these problems.
